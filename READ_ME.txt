Hello there dear ELITE TECH's members!

We've acomplished the following interface:
 - We have bot_simple that interfaces with the whatsapp.
   the backend is interfaced like this:
      no dialogues with the user are avaible.
      features recieve message as string, and number as string too.
      features are implemented at different branch and different file.
 - We have a basic 'print links' feature implemented at branch lidor_links.
   one can add more links to the 'links' array.
 - We have 'furtune' feature on brance 'furtune'. Unchecked.

 P.S.
 Read the comments in the code!!!!!
